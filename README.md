Scripts I use on a daily basis.

For the most part anyone should be able to use them.
Paths are agnostic, using `$home`, `/`, and environment variables.

You can clone this repository and configure it as an addtional environment path for all scripts. Making it easy to update when you pull changes. Each script is automatically assigned an alias that excludes the .ps1 extension. To setup this way:

Under `/setup` run `Create-Directories (optional)` -> `Set-Project-Env` -> `Set-Term-Settings (optional)` -> `Set-PS-Profile`.

Otherwise, feel free to copy and modify scripts as needed.
